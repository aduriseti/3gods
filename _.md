- 1.pl
    - establishes approach of "distinguishing question" - allows us to find qudestions that can distinguish a single god  who may be of tyopes truly or falsely
- 2.pl
- 6.pl
    - establishes approach of generating trees to partition families - but hangs when solving full complexity 3 gods problem
- 7.pl
    - adds an early stopping condition to tree generation - where - if # of familes we have to parition at any node in tree path is > 2 ^ questions left - we early stop
    - wasnt working
- 8.pl
    - adds a bunch of testing to debug 7
    - eventually realized that fully evaluating a question of the required complexity for our gramamr is too expensive by itself - some back of envelope math gives 100k possibel questions of complexity 2 (we know golden question has complexity 2)
- 9.pl
    - tries a new a approach were we only compose questions (make them more complex) - if it "impoves" the way they partition our families
    - it prunes too aggressively - trivially true quesiotn 1==1 is the "ideal" question from a partitioniong perspective - but we know it doens't form part of the ultimate golden questikon
- 10/11/12
    - explores idea of co generating the problem along side our questions
    - focuses on the step of decomposing the full complexity probnlem into 2 subproblems - 1 where R isn't allowed at position 2 and 1 where R isn't allowed at position 3
    - these 2 subprobklems can be solved in 2 questions each 
    - the golden question "is the random god directly adjacent and to thje righbt of hte true god" - when posed to position 1 - differentiates these 2 subproblems
    - wasnt abel to get this to work - but i think it should be possible - just errors in code (we can exhaustively search the complexity 2 grammar)
